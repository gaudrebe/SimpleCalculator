# SimpleCalculator
By Ben Gaudreau

A simple four-function calculator implementated using Python's Tkinter package. The key layout is rather crudely illustrated below.

---

| C | &#x00B1; | % | &#x221A; |

| 7 | 8 | 9 | &#x00F7; |

| 4 | 5 | 6 | &#x00D7; |

| 1 | 2 | 3 | - |

| 0 | . | = | + |

To run, simply execute calculator_app.py with Python. The latest version is preferred, but just about any should suffice.
